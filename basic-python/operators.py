#1. Arithmetic operators
a = 4 + 3 #addition a=7
b = 4 - 3 #subtraction b=1
c = 4 * 3 #multiplication c=12
d = 5 / 2 #division d=2.5
f = 5 // 2 #floor division f=2
e = 4 % 3 #modulus e = 1
g = 4 ** 2 #exponent g=16

#2. Comparison/Relational operators
a = 4==4 #equal to   a=true
b = 2!=0 #not equal to     b=true
c = 2<8 #less than      c=true
d = 2>3 #greater than     d = false
e = 2<=8 #less than or equal to       e = true
f = 2>=8 #greater than or equal to    f = false

#3. Logical operators
# and => It will return true only if both the condition returns true
# or => It will return true if any one of the conditions are true
# not => It will reverse the condition

#4. Bitwise operators
#  & (bitwise AND) => sets bit if both the bits are  1
#  ` (bitwise OR) => sets bit if any of the bit is 1
# ^ (XOR) => sets bit only if 1 bit is 1
# ~ (NOT) => flips bits (2's complement)
# << (left shift) => Shifts bits left
# >> (right shift) => shifts bits right

#5. Assignment Operators
# = (assign)
# += (add and assign)
# -= (subtract and assign)
# *= (multiply and assign)
# /= (divide and assign)
# //= (floor divide and assign)
# %= (modulus and assign)
# **= (exponent and assign)
# &= (bitwise and and assign)
# `= (bitwise or and assign)
# ^= (bitwise xor and assign)
# <<= (left shift and assign)
# >>= (right shift and assign)

#6. Identity Operator
# is => returns true if objects are the same for e.g. a is b
# is not => return true if objects are not the same for eg a is not b

#7 Membership Operators
#in => returns true if a value is available in the sequence
# not in => returns true if a value is not available in the sequence
