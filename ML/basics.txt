# ML definition
#Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for each task.

# Types 
1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

1. Supervised learning
-> We provide both input and output to the machine and it learns the mapping between them.
-> Common Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
-> We provide only the input without any labels, the model finds hidden patterns or groupings.
-> Common Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, PCA (for dimensionality reduction), DBSCAN

3. Reinforcement Learning
-> The agent interacts with environment and learns by trial and error. It gets rewards for good actions and punishments for bad actions.
-> Common Algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), Policy Gradient

Example:
Supervised Learning Example-> Email Spam Detection

Email Text	                                Label
“You won a free iPhone! Click here!”	    Spam
“Meeting agenda for tomorrow”	            Not Spam
“Get rich quick, limited time offer!”	    Spam


Unsupervised Learning Example: Customer Segmentation in a Shopping App
Customer	Age	    Avg. Purchase ($)	Visits/Month
A	        22	    50	                5
B	        40	    600	                2
C	        35	    500	                3
D	        24	    70	                6
You don’t know their categories, but you want to group them.

The model clusters customers into:
Group 1: Budget Shoppers
Group 2: Premium Shoppers
Group 3: Occasional Buyers
