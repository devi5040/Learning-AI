# ML definition
#Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for each task.

# Types 
1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

1. Supervised learning
-> We provide both input and output to the machine and it learns the mapping between them.
-> Common Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
-> We provide only the input without any labels, the model finds hidden patterns or groupings.
-> Common Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, PCA (for dimensionality reduction), DBSCAN

3. Reinforcement Learning
-> The agent interacts with environment and learns by trial and error. It gets rewards for good actions and punishments for bad actions.
-> Common Algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), Policy Gradient
