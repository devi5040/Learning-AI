Features
-> Input data that helps the model learn.

Labels.
-> Output / the answer we want the model to predict.

Example:
Size (sqft)	    Bedrooms	    Location	    Price ($)
1200	        2	            Urban	        200,000
=> Features = Size, Bedrooms, Location
=> Label = Price
*** “Given size, bedrooms, and location → What is the price?”


Training and Testing Split
Data Set	        Purpose
Training set	    Used to train the model (learn patterns)
Testing set	        Used to evaluate model performance
-> Typically the split is - 80% training, 20% testing (can also be 70-30 or 60-40)

Example Workflow:
You have 1,000 rows of data (houses).
Split:
800 → training
200 → testing
Train the model on 800 examples (it learns patterns).
Test it on 200 unseen examples (see how well it predicts).
